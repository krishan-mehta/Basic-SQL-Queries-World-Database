# 🛠️ Basic SQL Queries – World Database

This repository contains a SQL script titled **`world_db.sql`** that demonstrates a wide range of SQL fundamentals using the classic **Northwind** database.

## 📘 File Overview

The `world_db.sql` script covers:

- `SELECT` statements  
- `WHERE` clauses  
- `DISTINCT` and `COUNT`  
- Sorting with `ORDER BY`  
- Filtering with `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, and `IN`  
- Aggregation functions: `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `SUM`  
- Logical operators: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
- Different types of Join : `Left Join`, `Right Join` and `Outer Join`
- Subqueries  
- `LIMIT` and pagination  
  

These queries are perfect for:

- Beginners learning SQL syntax  
- Practicing with the Northwind schema  
- Quick reference for common SQL patterns
